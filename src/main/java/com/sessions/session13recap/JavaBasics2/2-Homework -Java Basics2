Declare and initialize variables: Declare and initialize variables of different data types such as int, double,
String, boolean, and char. Print out the values of these variables to verify that they were initialized correctly.

Arithmetic Operations: Declare two int variables and perform arithmetic operations on them, such as addition,
subtraction, multiplication, and division. Print out the results of each operation to verify that they were
calculated correctly.

Type Casting: Declare a variable of one data type, and then assign it to a variable of another data type using
type casting. For example, declare a double variable and assign it to an int variable using type casting.
Print out the value of the int variable to verify that the type casting was successful.

Constants: Declare a constant using the final keyword, and assign it a value. Use the constant in your code to
ensure that it cannot be changed.

Scope: Declare variables in different scopes, such as local scope, instance scope, and static scope.
Use the variables in your code to ensure that they are only accessible within their respective scopes.

Default Values: Declare variables of different data types without initializing them.
Print out their default values to verify that they were initialized correctly.
