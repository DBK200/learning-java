Challenge
Objectives: create classes and objects

- create 4 different classes that resemble real life examples (de ex, Student, Car, ...)
- for each class, define a set of properties and methods (some public methods at least) that have meaning in that class
- Create one extra class (called "ClassHomework") and create at least one object for each type of class.
    - in aceasta clasa ClassHomework apelam celelalte clase (cele 4 de la primul punct) si facem obiecte.
    - in aceasta clasa apelam si metodele obiectelor (cele publice)
- call the public methods for each object
