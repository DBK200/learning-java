1. Write a program to print all alphabets from a to z
2. Write a program to print reverse alphabets from Z to A
3. Write a program to print all odd number between 1 to 100
4. Write a Program to Check Given String is a Palindrome or Not
5. Write a program to find number and sum of all integer between 100 and 200 which are divisible by 9
6. Write a program to enter the numbers till the user wants and at the end the program should display the largest and smallest numbers entered.

Notes:
- there is more than one way to solve the exercises :)
- the inputs of the methods you write does not necessarily needs to come from the user input, but if you want you can use Scanner class to request inputs
from the user, for example:
         Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);
         String str = input.nextLine();
         //  this will wait for the user to input a String and then store it as a String object with the refference name "str"
         // in this way the values are dinamic, inserted by an user in the terminal

    - as an alternative, you can just provide a hardcoded String in your method like
     String str = "some string here for testing";
