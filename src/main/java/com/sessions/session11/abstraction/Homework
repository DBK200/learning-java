Homework

1. Create an abstract class 'Parent' with a method 'message'.
It has two subclasses each having a method with the same name 'message' that prints "This is first subclass" and "This is second subclass" respectively.
Call the methods 'message' by creating an object for each subclass.

2. Create an abstract class 'Bank' with an abstract method 'getBalance'.
$100, $150 and $200 are deposited in banks A, B and C respectively.
'BankA', 'BankB' and 'BankC' are subclasses of class 'Bank', each having a method named 'getBalance'.
Call this method by creating an object of each of the three classes.

3. An abstract class has a constructor which prints "This is constructor of abstract class", an abstract method named 'a_method'
and a non-abstract method which prints "This is a normal method of abstract class".
A class 'SubClass' inherits the abstract class and has a method named 'a_method' which prints "This is abstract method".
Now create an object of 'SubClass' and call the abstract method and the non-abstract method. (Analyse the result)

4. We have to calculate the area of a rectangle, a square and a circle.
Create an abstract class 'Shape' with three abstract methods namely ‘rectangleArea' taking two parameters, squareArea'
and ‘circleArea' taking one parameter each. The parameters of ‘rectangleArea ' are its length and breadth, that of ‘squareArea'
is its side and that of ‘circleArea' is its radius. Now create another class 'Area' containing all the three methods ' rectangleArea ',
‘squareArea' and ‘circleArea' for printing the area of rectangle, square and circle respectively.
Create an object of class 'Area' and call all the three methods.
