public class Singleton {

    private Singleton() {
        // Private constructor to prevent instantiation from outside the class
    }

    public synchronized static Singleton getInstance() {
        if (instance == null) {
            instance = new Singleton();

    }

    // Other methods and fields can be added below

//    In this example, the Singleton class has a private constructor to prevent direct instantiation.
//    The instance of the class is obtained through the static `getInstance()` method, which ensures that only one
//    instance of the class is created.
//    The double-checked locking mechanism is used to ensure thread safety when initializing the instance.
//    This means that if multiple threads access the `getInstance()` method at the same time when the instance is null,
//    only one thread will create the instance while other threads wait

//Advantages
//The Singleton pattern offers several advantages when used in Java or any other programming language:
//
//        1. Single instance: It ensures that there is only one instance of a class throughout the application. This can be useful in scenarios where multiple instances of a class can cause conflicts or unnecessary resource consumption.
//
//        2. Global access: The Singleton provides a global point of access to the instance, allowing other parts of the program to easily access and use its functionalities.
//
//        3. Resource optimization: Since only one instance is created, resource allocation and memory usage can be optimized. This can be particularly beneficial in situations where resources are limited or expensive, such as database connections or heavy objects.
//
//        4. Thread safety: By properly implementing thread safety mechanisms, a Singleton can guarantee safe access to its instance in multi-threaded environments. This prevents race conditions and ensures that all threads operate on the same instance.
//
//        5. Flexible initialization: Singletons can be used to initialize resources or configurations at the point of creation. This allows for more controlled initialization and avoids redundant initialization steps at multiple points in the application.
//
//        6. Easy maintenance: With a Singleton, managing and maintaining the instance becomes easier as it can be centralized within the class. Any changes or updates needed in the instance can be done in one place, making maintenance more efficient.
//
//        Note: While the Singleton pattern offers advantages in certain situations, it is important to use it judiciously and consider the specific requirements of your application. Overuse of Singletons can lead to tight coupling and difficulties in testing, so it's important to evaluate whether a Singleton is truly necessary before implementation.
